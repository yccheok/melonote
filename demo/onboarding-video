Transcript :

so it is the sick meaning secure and
govern growth and data science meaning
applied ml ml Ops and anti-abuse team
meeting that's a big mouthful we might
get a better name over time
um and uh that's our meeting for
September 14th or 15th in APAC and hi
Alan glad you're here why are you here
when it's midnight we can talk uh glad
you're here don't make it happen to come
to this meeting because it's really late
for you uh and maybe so but I'm glad
thanks for coming at least once
so um
news and events uh I've got a lot of
things on the agenda today because of
some of this uh so apologies for that
but I think it's gonna go down over time
based on feedback I'll work I'm going to
work to do more summarized
Communications to improve the signature
noise ratio in my communications to
groups of people including this group of
people uh this was worked in for this
group adding more items to our staff
meeting agenda often every only rather
than posting your slack Channel and I am
going to be assuming that people leaders
on the team will attend this meeting or
read the notes and not rely on the slack
channel so keep that in in mind
uh let's see B is a read-only item
unless anybody wants to discuss it
and see Phil has
hi um welcome Ellen uh to the to the
meeting
um I've asked Alan to step in as acting
full stack manager for security policies
while I hire an em
um Alan has graciously accepted
um this this wonderful opportunity so
welcome Ellen
thank you
um I've got the next item as well uh so
anti-abuse is moving product sections
from sick to data science
um
data science is effectively a rename of
the model Ops section so data science
will include two stages the existing
model Ops which has three groups in it
which one can talk more about
and
the anti-abuse stage which only
currently has one group which is called
anti-abuse I think at some point there
are plans to split anti-abuse into two
groups but that's not in the near near
to
and we're working through all the
changes around that there's lots of
workday changes lots of handbook changes
Mom did you want to say anything more
about data science or model Ops
uh no I think for us we just roll up to
data science to everything else uh stays
the same we still have the two main
groups apply to malops and then later
data offs as part of it yeah
so any thanks Thomas uh for continuing
to compile and report on across all of
my teams that I'm responsible for in the
engineering allocation meeting on error
budgets and reliability and security
incidents so really do appreciate that
Gotta Give Neal a high five too he does
that he does half of these now and uh
and apologies for the noise if I keep
asking for what's the story behind
what's going on with reliability or
security or or error budget stuff just
trying to provide your cover
and I apologies Neil I totally forgot
you took half a day since Thomas has
been doing it for so long but
appreciating you I know you volunteered
for it and we discussed it but I just
forgot kind of a thankless role honestly
and I I volunteered because of the
exposure I get from it it's nice to be
part of a different Collective group of
people
I was going to mention I'll type this in
here
um but Thiago had set up for container
security a bot that Weekly I think it's
Mondays or like Sunday we'll ping the
team and ask for a volunteer to go and
resource that data and we just enabled
it for threat insights it's actually
pretty sweet and it just it does all the
work for you Thomas right we don't have
to Ping people ourselves so I'll put a
note in there for that
hey
f is read only and Bill you've got G
yeah um challenge assessment uh so we
had an update from Juliana
um the the dates haven't been confirmed
yet but it'll be sometime from
mid-october through till December I
think e-group sign off is expected to be
mid-December before everyone goes on
holiday
um they've got a draft timeline in there
but the dates the dates aren't in the
handbook yet
um the the big changes we're moving to
do it in workday that's not available
yet I haven't seen a demo of it I don't
know what questions will be asked but
there's an optional self-evaluation
which will move into workday and then
the work that we do as managers will
also happen in workday
um at the moment uh some people are
using the Google Doc which is listed on
the talent assessment page for
self-evaluations and for the manager
work I'd suggest continuing to use those
docs until we get access to workday and
see what the exact differences are
each A and J are read only unless
anybody wants to discuss them
Thomas
you get Adam K yeah apologies for the
late like live addition to the agenda on
this one but one more note on a change
we're rolling out within secure pretty
lightweight and that we're establishing
a second team within Dynamic analysis
um and so uh issue is there where folks
want to play that would like to follow
along or ask any questions about it
um
for the plan for right now as I'm going
to be serving as a team's acting em
um and in addition to normally scheduled
uh
some duties for lack of a better way of
putting it and so happy to answer any
questions that folks have about that
I had a quick question uh We've we've
done the same thing in three insights
with with Neil and and Thiago each
having teams what are you going to call
your new team or how will you
differentiate
was not planning to differentiate it
it's just a second team within Dynamic
analysis we're not creating a new group
which I think is the same pattern that's
happening within thread insights as well
it's just two teams no I know that
there's tangerine and there's Navy
um
I'm not a tangerine person myself
um so we will have to figure it out yeah
I don't know if there's another tea
color Thomas I struggled with that one
but that's the theme
tomato I don't know we'll figure it out
we'll figure it out
we'll figure it out the differentiation
I think the difference between what's
happening in threat insights and within
Dynamic analysis is that this is a split
or long feature category
um even though we're keeping that we're
not supporting a new group it is there's
the distinction is along like who's
working on specific feature categories
themselves so the the uh the the where
the fracture point is happening is is a
little different but the but the
approach and effect are the same
I hope
so on to big rocks and hot issues uh
section
um I know there's a big rock but kind of
belonged here perhaps more than other
places so did that survey where you got
an awesome response rate from the team
on how to improve the Mr rate for the
team
and then I took a really long time to go
through all the results and summarize
and make initial recommendations so you
lost a little bit of moment momentum I
got caught up in other things like
cross-functional prioritization and a
customer escalation so since then this
is actually used by John hope to lead a
discussion at the development uh
off-site last week on just improving
engineering velocity is one of the
things he used to power it so it had
value there but I've seen no comments I
think from anybody in this group which
means either no time forgot about it or
it doesn't
we looked at it and it doesn't have much
value and any of those things are okay
I'm just curious where
the group landed
and if you haven't taken a look yet to
see if there's anything you want to take
away from it on things you might want to
consider and asking you to do so uh and
uh to consider not to do but to consider
anybody got a chance to read it yet
um and think about it or not just yet
it's not my guess is perhaps everybody's
really busy and they haven't looked yet
I I mean at a high level uh Jai Neo
Thiago we've talked about changes I
think Jay you've already looked at some
changes around refinement that was an
area that you were going to look at for
anti-abuse and report back by the end of
the quarter
um Thiago and Neil I cannot remember
what uh where we ended up with for
Sweden sites yeah I'm hoping that Mr
rate is kind of an artifact or a
byproduct of some other actions the big
thing we're doing is more whole
paperwork like random miscellaneous not
scheduled not PM necessarily actions or
issues and that actually is creating
um some more additional work like it's
just like free time work I want to
change a pace move to something else
momentarily and these are generally
smaller types of issues too so they're
quicker to knock out therefore they
create more Mrs which has been a cool
byproduct so I think that's helping us
succeed there
yeah we're also seeing some success with
uh We've implemented like a weekly
refinement meeting I kind of check in
make sure that uh stories are broken
down tiny enough I think with smaller
bits of work we're seeing a higher mr8
um it's debatable whether or not that's
like
just inflated right like you can work on
a small piece of code and ship it and
you can do that a lot of times you're
going to get a higher Mr rate we're
trying to be reasonable with that
um I am noticing a nice tick up uh after
implementing the refinement meeting so
let's hope for the best
I was going to say one note on
refinement
um in stack analysis we're experimenting
with the new section in our planning
feature just called looking forward and
in there we're using that is like a
baseline where we add issues that we
think need refinement that will most
likely be worked on in the next one to
three Milestones so we're using that as
kind of a base cover for some engineer
to go in and add their issues and make
sure they get refined within this
Milestone not necessarily any
implementation but just refinement
itself
I should stop talking on mute thank you
Omar Thomas you want to verbalize your
comment yeah I'll verbalize and then
I'll say more and then I'll finish
writing what I was going to put down
underneath in just a moment uh so the
this was an agenda item with the EMS and
I can say it now in the secure stage
um since that is the analyzer teams now
uh so this was a topic yesterday so my I
would assume that this is more like it's
had a chance to read but not digest the
content
um and what I was about to write and I
am cautious in saying this because it
almost comes across as smug and that is
not my intent
um in that
looking at the Mr rate within SEC
compared to company-wide historically it
runs two to three Mrs per engineer per
month higher
um and I think a good bit of that has to
do with the
I mean it I mean we've taken this to be
true or at least asserted it to be true
in that it's smaller teams that are
working closely together in less busy
projects uh than we see within the rails
platform itself which does have an
impact
um
uh it's um it that's not to say that we
cannot do better
um but the the comparison
the the favorable comparison
at least to me and I will admit this at
times will lessen the urgency on this
particular topic and I have to admit
that bias that I have
thanks Thomas thanks everyone so I
didn't see any comments in the issue but
that's totally fine people found some of
it useful some of the analysis useful uh
and that's great so I will close the
issue accordingly and just link to these
notes good stuff Thomas you've got Item
B
okay all right after this then all right
bed ramp and the can't or won't fix
security issues that way maybe we may be
having there's uh so we've got them uh
the the for security issues that are
subject to Fed ramp if we if you have a
feature category that is dips compliant
or certified you're probably going to be
part of the FED ramp evaluation and any
security issue that has a cve associated
with it which means dependency or
container scanning specifically
um has to have a remediation plan even
if they're false positives
um and so that's led to a separate
discussion on
what do we need to do
uh for do we need to do anything related
to security findings on the commercial
versions of analyzer specifically that
was the Catalyst for this particular
conversation uh because on container
scanning we get a lot of findings
related to Debian based images that that
project has not shipped to fix for or
won't fix ship a fix for
um so there is a separate thread that is
going on here about what to do and can
we do deviation requests in bulk for
this class of for the for this for for
this class of um of findings
um the the tldr is below
um and there's a couple of all there's a
couple of all of options that are being
brainstormed within this particular
thread so I wanted and I know I've said
a lot of words and I didn't say it well
uh but uh I wanted to bring it here uh
in case there was any questions or
commentary
nothing directly related to what you've
just talked about but but sort of
related uh for food brand you're looking
at
[Music]
um
any fips related uh security issues that
have been raised how far are you going
in terms of auditing to find anything
that hasn't already been identified
there is I'll I'll link in another issue
a separate issue that is give that has
instructions from appsec on what they
would like us to do as far as setting up
container scanning
um uh and uh
they have set up a project with a single
configuration
um that they're asking us to use there
is some debate as to uh as to how that
project has been configured because it
uses a combination of three container
scanning tools rather than one
um
and uh uh and so they've asked us to use
that as a baseline uh for the fips
images specifically
since they're Ubi or the Ubi
specific images
they're they're equivalent in my mind
even though they're they're they're
different meanings
so tldr talk to appsig got it nikhil
nikhil George is our stable counterpart
I focus on no at least in SEC
um and so he's been quite responsive and
keen and he is also helping chase down
answers when uh when he doesn't have
them so uh that's a
big uh he's been he's been a big help
thus far
so in uh thanks for bringing this up
Thomas
so in the hallway so from the
development staff meeting meeting uh I
copied and pasted the notes
um
in there but Ned is the tldr is can
focus the request to me and my peers was
can folks check with their teams to see
if the approvals are affecting them
so this is the new approval rules on
segregation of Duty so I asked this
group not that everybody's here but in
the group and they shouldn't be because
all meetings are optional but have has
this had an impact these new approval
rules
and exactly I've seen a few cases where
uh team members have realized that they
need to get an additional approval
um but I'm not aware that it's actually
slowing things down
okay
no news is good news on this probably
unless we're missing unless unless it's
happening and we're not noticing it
we're just slowing things down but just
keep an eye on it in case it does
everyone please so good stuff so
um
with recent changes
we've done a couple different changes
with the secure and govern broken air
from secure and our data Ops Team and
this net is I just compared to the name
of my team with my peers my peers have
one word team names Ops Dev create Etc
mine is SEC growth and data science
which is pretty wordy and also makes it
like when I go into dashboards I have to
pull data from multiple places across my
teams so I was thinking about a one word
name I've started to get feedback on it
naming things is really important at
gitlab to name the right kinds of things
and give them good names so I'm going to
run it by David de Santo tomorrow and
he's a great person to bounce such
things off of
I landed on enrichment because what we
do makes other things better we enrich
them
uh it's kind of a very broad term but it
does cover what we do not sure we're
going to change the name which I'm not
sure it's going to affect anyone but me
uh that's actually my intent is it only
affects my stuff not everyone else's
uh but at least everyone else is in a
small way or others in a small way but
we'll see
um any thoughts on this good idea bad
idea I'm not wed to this I'm looking for
feedback
um yeah obviously the other examples
relate to either sections or stages
whereas an enrichment doesn't so you'd
be introducing something new here
um this affects me as well I have a
subset of enrichment so it would be kind
of enrichment light
I'm not sure I'm not sure where I think
you and I've spoken about this I'm not
sure we would get approval to introduce
a new name or Department level we'd
certainly have to talk to people Ops
about introducing that in workday
okay
so a couple of things you know these
kinds of things I would sometimes put in
slack but I'm trying to avoid number of
distinct slack messages so putting it in
here making a lot read only when
possible so I've got C though which is
not read only sorry I would like to add
announcements of work anniversaries and
new hires to the meeting template PM
does this I attended the PM staff
meeting I was a guest speaker there this
week and like the camaraderie we have
good camaraderie the camaraderie there
was pretty good uh you know Fern who's
shadowing me today I think he sat in on
the PM meeting as well it was it's a
pretty good feel of just people really
knowing each other well and getting
along well
um so those are just two things I took
away from it is anniversaries and new
hires
um oh verbalized thiago's uh comment
let's go here yeah great idea for new
hires don't care much about work
anniversaries we already bought for that
um what I'd say is I always seem to miss
about announcements uh as they cover the
whole company versus about just
announcing for our team if no interest
in that part I'm happy to exclude so
Neil you like the idea of adding yes or
you don't I mean just last week I think
it was Phil celebrated his third year
and I congratulated him but then I
missed another team member in sec
you know because there's like 20 people
on that list plus it's team member
updates that's not a channel I look at a
lot like weekly I just happen to see
that the day of so I do like being able
to celebrate together in this group
maybe also thanks or praise section like
thanks for doing this
and great job on that
to remind ourselves to do that and as
Engineers we tend to focus on the
problems and challenges and not the
celebrating the wins
are you suggesting that we add new
content into this document for that or
that we just linked to the slack
announcements that we've already made
I think it's nice to verbalize them
so maybe link to the slack announcements
but also verbalize it I know it sounds
like a bunch of busy work
um I don't want to do things twice
um maybe we add the sections and people
use them as they see fit
whatever that happens to me but please
don't over
don't create busy work for yourself
either so so judgment call by each
person
Thomas looks like you had a Thomas and
mon you had some thoughts on this too
yeah I like it we don't celebrate enough
we don't do enough for
team cohesion team celebration
uh across the board and just as a
corollary related thing that I haven't
communicated well I was hoping to add
this kind of thing to our monthly
section-wide retrospectives new hires
discretionary bonuses work anniversaries
big feature releases I mean anything
that we want to announce and celebrate
we ought to make sure that it's
I don't want to say shout to the
rooftops but we're shut to the heavens
but but
they're big deals and we don't make it
and and we underself
in my opinion yeah oh sorry and hey uh
Fernando here so I'm shadowing uh Wayne
now just to introduce myself um from the
technical marketing team
um and I'm I'll send the document right
now which is something that we do for
our
um kind of get together team meetings
and it kind of shows
um you can you can look through it I
shared it to everyone on the zoom chat
but you can see that we provide updates
the new team members and small little
introductions and you can see sections
that we have on gratitude and actual um
spotlights that we show like who we're
actually praising what they've done
that's good
um and how we can highlight that because
that will motivate employees kind of
really increase that morale because what
we're seeing is
um these employees are actually getting
recognized for good work that they've
done and they're getting shout outs
because a lot of times at least in our
team the case is we don't really
although we work with each other where
we we sometimes are kind of siled busy
working on different things so it's good
to know what everyone's working on and
what everyone's doing so somewhat
related to to what you were just
speaking on but just thought I'd share
that
thanks Fernando
doing D so I'm not going to read all
this from Daniel Croft but
um summarizing he is looking for
feedback on the development vision and
Mission and direction we're
brainstorming on in the development
department on Mission Envision in
particular the approach is we want
everybody to open up a little
spreadsheet and follow the instructions
anybody interested so if you're
interested in doing so it should take
about 10 to 15 minutes please do it in
the next week
good stuff there something we covered
also the development off-site uh that
Daniel took as an action item to follow
up on
uh Thomas you've got e yep all right
because I cannot remember and so I'm
hoping to crowdsource a little bit of uh
this uh configuration archeology so to
speak
um
is there a reason that we don't use
reviewer roulette
if folks can remember the reason I'm
asking is is contained within that
thread but that is a tool that actually
is being used to track if we have enough
maintainers on any given project and
since we don't use it we're showing up
um and so that's why I was that's why
I'm asking yeah when you say review a
roulette are you talking about on the
individual analyzers yeah
foreign
need for it because we have
six Engineers that's just gonna rule
that the same six people yeah roll a
six-sided die that's what I kind of
think it is but it's uh from a larger
like if the company uh like where do we
need more maintainers is the question
that the organization is asking
um
I may not suggest they're looking in the
wrong place if they're looking and
related
um to see to find out the number of
maintainers that's the wrong place the
engineering projects page should list
all the maintainers if you've set up
your team yaml entries correctly uh I
would have thought that was more the
single source of Truth
apparently not
so yeah
yeah I'm looking at the chart I mean I
think on some of these projects we just
haven't filled it out
um I'll give you like we have the API
um big Hub files we have one engineer
that works on it uh so we haven't gone
and added a maintainer there because
they know who they are
um so if we are trying to maintain that
as a single source of Truth we need to
just go through and scrub it
I'm reminded of the Spider-Man meme with
the two Spider-Man pointing at each
other who's the reviewer who's the
author it's it's the same person
it's been it's been a long day so I'm a
little Punchy so but yes that makes
sense
so safety is saying you you haven't
added it to individual team members yaml
files in the handbook queue right I
believe for that one uh we there's just
no entry for it I mean we could I think
I think that should do it yeah well it
should they shouldn't be using just
roulette they should be using that as a
source of foods and I think if you've
listed maintainers that should cover it
the follow-up question would be does
that uh does that cover the senior plus
Engineers must be a maintainer
requirement or not
I promise you buried the the what do you
call it buried the lead
I I took the read-only off your comment
there so you can announce it well we're
going to end with the best news of the
day that's all that's all right but
um it's but the maintaining requirement
yes it does I mean because it's required
for senior plus going back to that it's
just maintaining one or more I think is
the requirement for remember Brooklyn
I was talking about the olivian news
yeah I know I was just making sure we
were finished with the topic above all
right
and we're at time so I will move on and
take that as a prompt yeah Olivier has
uh popped back on slack to announce that
the newest edition of their family is
here and happened over the weekend yeah
so uh so uh big big congrats to his
family for that and uh we'll be uh
hoping to celebrate him
uh later when he does when he when he
returns to work
Google thanks everybody have a great day
